# CurrentLife App
 My idea of a super-app

 So these are just my morning thoughts of a personal-life-centered app, in which a person could store an inventory of his/her life parameters and features.

 I imagine this as a chest ot a dashboard with access to different modules (those that you decide to have sinificance in your life).

 My diet.
 My movies.
 My husband.
 My future.
 My health.

 Nowadays smartphones are storing a lion's share of such information, but in a way that is smartphone-centered, apps-focused, which is not that convenient to a person.

 Yes, one can organize anything the way he or she wants, but what if there was a dedicated environment.

 It could have templates as well as a fully customizable mode.

 New modules could be just links to side apps, but with growth all these apps could obtain similar design and structure to make the environment look as a whole consistent world.

 Your world. Your Current Life.

 Sharing this since I believe that the more we share, the more we are able to create.
